Image Scroll View

The goal of this test is to create a responsive single-page app which will show a list of images
retrieved from flickr API. The app should have a front-end and a back-end component,
behaving as follows:

1. Front end, which offers two columns. Image thumbnails down the left hand side and the
title of the image down the right hand side.
2. The app should provide an infinite scroll experience
3. There should be a back-end component, written as a node module, which performs the
fetching of images. You don’t want your API key out in the public, after all :)
4. The app should hold an open connection to the server, taking incremental updates (i.e.
no poll).

Extra points

For extra points, you can do the following:
- Add a ‘sort alphabetically’ option, to sort the images on the front-end

If you want to play around with API queries, you can use the YQL console here . It will generate
a REST query uri at the bottom of the screen as follows:

select * from flickr.photos.recent where api_key=00ac5f70d662304b87e7da585bbdef9d
https://query.yahooapis.com/v1/public/yql?q=select%20*%20from%20flickr.photos.recent%20w
here%20api_key%3D00ac5f70d662304b87e7da585bbdef9d&format=json&diagnostics=true&ca
llback=

You can construct image URLs according to the following documentation:
https://www.flickr.com/services/api/misc.urls.html

Here is a simple example:
Image object from query response:

{"farm":"6","id":"31253663191","isfamily":"0","isfriend":"0","ispublic":"1","owner":"146037960@N
02","secret":"d3da9dc2ef","server":"5509","title":"First snow in Seoul"},

The URL you will construct to retrieve a medium size image
